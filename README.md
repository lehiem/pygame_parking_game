<h1>Parking Game</h1>

In this game, players control two different colored cars (pink and blue) with the goal of parking them in their respective parking spots. The game requires coordination and precision to maneuver the cars and successfully park them in the designated areas. Players compete against each other to see who can park their car first. The game combines elements of racing and puzzle-solving as players navigate through the parking lot to claim victory. Both players can win if they both get into their parking spot. You may also not go on the shaded red areas or else you lose and the game will shut off.


<h1>Platform and Technology Needed to Play</h1>
The game requires a Python application downloaded.
